[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     The [1mmkify [22mutility copies installed BSDBuild include files from their sys-
     tem location to [4mmk[24m under the working directory.  It accepts a list of
     BSDBuild modules as arguments (e.g., `prog' will cause build.prog.mk(5)
     to be installed).  [1mmkify [22malso scans for include directives and will auto-
     matically install all dependencies as well.

     The BSDBuild build system is designed to be bundled with applications as
     a stand-alone set of make(1) include files, which are typically installed
     in a directory named [4mmk[24m in the top-level directory (or some other central
     location) in an application source code, such that people building appli-
     cations which use the BSDBuild build system do not need to have BSDBuild
     or any other software installed on their systems.

     While the need for a [4mmk[24m directory may be perceived as a problem, there
     are several advantages:

     1.   Makefiles are not generated, they can be edited directly.  BSDBuild
          will generate Makefiles only when performing concurrent builds
          (i.e., building object files in a directory separate from the source
          tree).

     2.   BSDBuild makefiles are orders of magnitude smaller than any gener-
          ated Makefile, avoiding masses of redundant code.

     3.   There is no [4mMakefile.in[24m, so the total number of files in your tree
          is reduced.
