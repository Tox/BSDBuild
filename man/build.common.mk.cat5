[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     [1mbuild.common.mk [22mdefines common variables that are used by the different
     BSDBuild modules.  They can be referenced from Makefiles, but they are
     almost always treated read-only and overrided by a [4mMakefile.config[24m gener-
     ated by a configure script (see mkconfigure(1) for details).

[1mTARGETS[0m
     This module defines no target.

[1mVARIABLES[0m
     PREFIX               Base target installation directory.  Defaults to
                          `/usr/local'.

     DESTDIR              Optional prefix for all installation directories.
                          This variable is typically passed as an argument to
                          a `make install' command.  Defaults to an empty
                          string.

     STATEDIR             Installation directory for writeable machine-wide
                          data files.  Defaults to `PREFIX/var'.

     SYSCONFDIR           System-wide configuration directory.  Defaults to
                          `PREFIX/etc'.

     DATADIR              Installation directory for read-only machine-wide
                          data files.

     BINDIR               Installation directory for executables.  Defaults to
                          `PREFIX/bin'.

     LIBDIR               Installation directory for library files.  Defaults
                          to `PREFIX/lib'.

     MODULEDIR            Installation directory for dynamically-loaded mod-
                          ules.  Defaults to `PREFIX/lib' (but this default is
                          almost always overridden by the application's con-
                          figure script).

     INCLDIR              Installation directory for library header files.
                          Defaults to `PREFIX/include'.

     MANDIR               Installation directory for manual pages.  Defaults
                          to `PREFIX/man'.

     SUDO                 Optional path to sudo(8).  If set, all modules will
                          use it for privileged commands.

     FIND                 Path to the `find 1' command.  Not used by BSDBuild
                          itself, but useful for maintainer scripts and such.

     AWK                  Path to `awk' interpreter.  Not used by BSDBuild
                          itself, but useful for maintainer scripts and such.

     INSTALL_PROG         Command to execute for installing an executable
                          file.  Defaults to `install -c -m 755'.

     INSTALL_LIB          Command to execute for installing a library file.
                          Defaults to `install -c -m 644'.

                          file.  Defaults to `install -c -m 644'.

     DEINSTALL_PROG       Command to execute for uninstalling an executable.

     DEINSTALL_LIB        Command to execute for uninstalling a library.

     DEINSTALL_DATA       Command to execute for uninstalling a data file.

     DEINSTALL_INCL       Command to execute for uninstalling a library header
                          file.
