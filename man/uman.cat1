[1mNAME[0m
     [1muman [22m-- Uninstalled manual page reader

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
     [1muman [22m[[4msearch-string[24m]

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     The [1muman [22mscript formats and displays uninstalled manual pages, without
     using the system manual.  The [4msearch-string[24m argument should be a manual
     page title (or in the case of library documentation, the name of a func-
     tion, structure or class).

     The UMANPATH environment variable should be defined as a comma-separated
     list of directories containing manual page source files such as [4mfoo.1[24m,
     and optionally BSDBuild-generated [4m.manlink.mk[24m files.  [1muman [22mwill search
     the directories recursively.

     If a match is found, [1muman [22mformats and feeds the resulting manual page to
     the system PAGER (or the default, less(1)).
