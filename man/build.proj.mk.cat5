     [1mbuild.proj.mk [22m-- bsdbuild - compilation of IDE project files

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
     [1m.include <bsd.proj.mk>[0m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     The [1mbuild.proj.mk [22mmodule uses the premake(1) utility to generate "project
     files", so that BSDBuild projects can be opened by various IDEs (Inte-
     grated Development Environments).

     This module adds the target "proj", so that "make proj" will compile the
     project files, and pack them into sets of archive files (under PROJDIR,
     which defaults to "./ProjectFiles").

     The various profiles are defined by the space-separated list PROJFILES.
     Each entry in PROJFILES has the format:

           <OS>:<IDE>:<FLAVOR>:<OPTIONS>

     "<OS>" specifies the operating system and "<IDE>" is the target IDE name.
     The "<FLAVOR> argument is a flavor or variant identifier (e.g.,
     "nothreads"), and "<OPTIONS>" is a comma-separated list of ./configure
     options (e.g., "--disable-threads").

     Valid "<OS>" values include:

     windows             Windows 95 and up
     windows-xp          Windows XP and up
     windows-xp-x64      Windows XP and up (64-bit)
     windows-vista       Windows Vista and up
     windows-vista-x64   Windows Vista and up (64-bit)
     windows-7           Windows 7 and up
     windows-7-x64       Windows 7 and up (64-bit)

     Note: Premake does support other targets ("bsd", "linux" and "macosx"),
     but it rarely if ever necessary to generate project files for those tar-
     gets since they already provide a proper compilation environment (i.e.,
     BSDBuild can be used directly on them).

     Valid "<IDE>" target names include:

     cb-gcc     Code::Blocks with gcc
     vs6        Visual Studio 6
     vs2002     Visual Studio 2002
     vs2003     Visual Studio 2003
     vs2005     Visual Studio 2005
     monodev    MonoDevelop
     sharpdev   ICSharpCode SharpDevelop

[1mTARGETS[0m
     [4mproj[24m   If PROJECT is defined, generate the project files.  Otherwise,
            only generate PREMAKEOUT in the current directory.

[1mVARIABLES[0m
     PROJECT          Name of project.  If a project has multiple subdirecto-
                      ries, this should only be defined in the top-level
                      directory.

     PROJFILES        List of project files to generate (see DESCRIPTION
                      above).

     PROJDIR          Directory to hold generated project file archives.

     PROJFILESEXTRA   List of additional files to include in all project file
                      archives.

     PROJINCLUDES     List of additional premake scripts to include every-
                      where.

     PREMAKE          Path to premake(1) utility.

     ZIP              Path to zip(1) utility.

     ZIPFLAGS         Flags to zip(1).

     MKPROJFILES      Path to mkprojfiles(1) utility (which is part of BSD-
                      Build).

     PREMAKEOUT       Filename of premake input generated by BSDBuild
                      (defaults to [4mpremake.lua[24m).

     PREMAKEFLAGS     Flags to premake utility.
